/**
 * Hook delivery idempotency table.
 *
 * Records every hook job outcome, keyed by the BullMQ job ID. Processing
 * rows are short leases so a crash before the side effect can recover;
 * completed rows deduplicate BullMQ replays.
 *
 * This closes a long-standing gap where worker crashes mid-handler caused
 * BullMQ to re-run the job on the next boot — re-firing webhooks (visible
 * to customers as duplicate deliveries) and re-billing OpenAI for
 * sentiment + embedding work that already completed.
 *
 * `processedAt` lets us prune rows older than the BullMQ retention window
 * (rows for completed jobs older than 24h are useless because BullMQ has
 * forgotten the job by then).
