/**
 * Apply the external side-effect ledger after a database restore.
 *
 * Restoring a backup rewinds the database but not the world. Emails that were
 * sent are still sent, webhooks that were delivered are still delivered, and
 * every column recording those acts has been rewound along with everything
 * else. Call this once, at the end of a restore and before the schedulers are
 * allowed to run, and each column in `side-effect-ledger.ts` gets the policy
 * its consumer needs so nothing is re-sent.
 *
 * The posture is suppress-by-default. Nothing is replayed unless the caller
 * names the exact columns it wants replayed, so forgetting the option gives
 * the safe outcome and asking for a replay is a deliberate act that shows up
 * in the audit metadata.
 *
 * Every statement is written to be a no-op on a second run with the same
 * `restoredTo`, and they all commit in one transaction with the audit row, so
 * the operation is safely repeatable: an interrupted restore can simply run
 * it again.
 *
 * This module deliberately does no logging. It returns a structured report
 * and lets the caller, which owns a logger, record it.
