/**
 * Ticket read receipts (unified inbox §3.3), mirroring the conversation unread
 * model (conversation.query.ts's unreadCountFor / batched list-unread query,
 * conversation.service.ts's markConversationRead) but against
 * conversation_messages WHERE ticket_id = X. A ticket message's senderType
 * discriminates the side ('agent' == assignee, 'visitor' == requester) the
 * same way ticket-message.service.ts's insertTicketMessage does; internal
 * notes and soft-deleted messages never count toward either side's unread.
 *
 * CONVERGENCE PHASE 2 — READ-THROUGH (scratchpad/convergence-design.md, "the
 * pair runs on the conversation's two watermarks"). A customer ticket and its
 * linked conversation are ONE item with ONE shared watermark per side; reading
 * either surface of the pair marks BOTH read ("a ticket is marked
 * as read when the linked conversation is read"). The mark-read entry points
 * here therefore resolve the pair first and, for a linked customer ticket,
 * delegate to the conversation's own mark-read (which writes
 * `conversations.agent_last_read_at` / `visitor_last_read_at` and publishes
 * the conversation 'read' event) instead of touching the legacy ticket
 * columns. The legacy `tickets.*_last_read_at` columns stay live ONLY for
 * back-office/tracker tickets, which kept their own ticket-scoped threads —
 * post-0218 (Phase 6) every requester-holding customer ticket is a pair, so
 * the only standalone customer tickets left are the inert no-requester legacy
 * edge. Unread COUNTS for a linked pair likewise read the conversation
 * watermark (the Messages surface's conversation badges — the requester-side
 * ticket count retired with the converged surface; conversation unreads are
 * the complete requester truth by construction).
 *
 * CONVERGENCE PHASE 3 — WRITER CLEANUP COMPLETE: nothing writes the legacy
 * ticket watermark columns for a linked customer ticket anymore. The one
 * remaining writer Phase 2 left behind — `markTicketUnreadFromMessage` with a
 * legacy ticket-parented anchor on a pair — now moves the CONVERSATION's agent
 * watermark instead. The columns are legacy-READ only on the customer axis
 * (a pair's frozen pre-link values are simply never consulted) and remain
 * live for back-office/tracker.

 * actually see, not any ticket in the workspace); the anchor message must not

 * consults. The ticket-column write below therefore remains ONLY for unlinked
 * threads — back-office/tracker tickets, whose rows are all ticket-parented
