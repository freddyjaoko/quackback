/**
 * Durable workflow waits (support platform §4.6, Slice 5e). A 'wait' node parks a
 * run; this is the BullMQ delayed job that resumes it when the timer fires. The
 * job id is keyed by run id plus a per-run wait sequence number, so re-scheduling
 * the same wait (e.g. after a retry) dedupes rather than stacking, while a later
 * wait in the same run gets its own job instead of colliding with an earlier one
 * that is still active or retained. The worker re-loads the run and calls
 * resumeWorkflowRun, which itself no-ops if a reply/close interrupted the run in
 * the meantime.
 *
 * Registered in the worker registry so boot/drain manage it like every other
 * queue; it initializes lazily on the first scheduled wait.
