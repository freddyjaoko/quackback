/**
 * Workflow effectiveness reporting (support platform §4.6, §7). Read-only
 * aggregates over workflow_runs — runs started / completed / interrupted /
 * still-waiting per workflow over a date range, the effectiveness view the
 * support dashboard shows. `started` is the total (every run row); the rest are
 * the terminal/pending states.
 *
 * `sentRuns` / `engagedRuns` extend the same rollup with the per-workflow
 * funnel (sent -> engaged -> completed, `completed` already above): distinct
 * runs with at least one `block_sent` / `block_engaged` event
 * (action.executor.ts / event-trigger.ts) among the SAME [from, to) window's
 * runs.
 *
 * listWorkflowRuns / workflowRunTimeline (below) are the per-run drill-down a
 * failing workflow needs: workflow_run_events is written on every state
 * transition (workflow-run-events.ts's logRunEvent) but had no read side
 * until now — the manager list only ever showed the trailing-7d
 * started/completed counts above.

  // block_engaged from a run that started inside the window.
  //
  // Query-plan choice: workflow_runs.started_at is already indexed
  // (workflow_runs_started_at_idx, used by the query above), so the planner
  // narrows to this window's runs FIRST and joins onto workflow_run_events by
  // run id — cheaper than a plan anchored on workflow_run_events, which has
  // no index on run_id or kind at all (only the (workflow_id,
  // subject_principal_id, at) cap_idx, built for the frequency-cap accounting
  // query and of no help for a cross-workflow scan keyed on kind/at). Either
  // plan pays one scan of workflow_run_events; anchoring on workflow_runs
  // means that scan is a hash/merge join probe against an already-narrow set
  // of run ids instead of a scan that then has to look started_at up per row.
