/**
 * The condition-context resolver (§4.6, Slice 4): reads the DB once to build the
 * `ConditionContext` snapshot the pure evaluator reads. The engine resolves this
 * once per trigger and reuses it across every condition in the workflow, so
 * evaluation stays DB-free and the snapshot is a single consistent instant.
 *
 * The triggering message (if any) is passed in by the caller — it comes from the
 * trigger event, not a query — so a "message contains X" condition sees the
 * message that fired the workflow, not merely the conversation's latest.
 *
 * `person`/`company` (person.attr.*, company.attr.*, person.email, and the
 * first-class person.country / person.locale / person.plan) are
 * resolved by one extra query alongside the rest (resolvePersonCompanyContext
 * below): the visitor principal's own user row (email, country, locale
 * columns; metadata for attributes and plan), plus their linked
 * company's attributes via principal.company_id. An anonymous visitor or one
 * with no company simply misses the corresponding join — the evaluator's
 * unresolved-subject contract (condition.evaluator.ts) already handles an
 * absent subject, so no special-casing is needed here beyond returning an
 * attribute-less snapshot. That join is skippable (`opts.resolvePersonCompany`
 * below) when the caller already knows nothing will ever read it.
 *
 * `ticket` (ticket.type) is resolved the same way, from the conversation's
 * paired CUSTOMER ticket (resolveTicketContext below) and behind its own
 * skip flag (`opts.resolveTicket`). Resolving it from the conversation rather
 * than from the trigger's payload is what makes it survive a resume: a run
 * parked at a wait re-resolves its snapshot from the conversation alone.
