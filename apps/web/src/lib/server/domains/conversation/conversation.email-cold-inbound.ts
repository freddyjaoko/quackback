/**
 * Cold-inbound sender resolution (support platform §4.8 Layer 2). When an email
 * arrives that isn't a reply to an existing conversation, this decides WHO it is
 * from, gated by the DMARC trust verdict and the decided identity model
 * (IDENTITY-MODEL-ANALYSIS.md): inbound email attaches by address only under a
 * DMARC pass ("verified lead"); anything weaker becomes a standalone unverified
 * lead; a hard reject is dropped.
 *
 *   - drop   → hard DMARC reject; the caller creates nothing.
 *   - attach → an existing principal already owns this address: either a DMARC
 *              pass matching a known user account (a verified lead adopting a
 *              known contact), or a lead we minted from an earlier mail. Reusing
 *              the lead is what lets a block on a cold sender actually hold.
 *   - create → a new anonymous principal carrying the (verified-or-not) contact
 *              email; `unverified` drives the agent-facing "unverified sender"
 *              badge and blocks silent attachment to a known identity.
 *
 * Resolution only touches identity; the caller owns creating the conversation.
