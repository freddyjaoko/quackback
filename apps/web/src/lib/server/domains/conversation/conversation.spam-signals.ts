/**
 * Deterministic (non-AI) inbound spam signals. These run BEFORE the AI
 * classifier on every new-conversation ingest path: a matching signal files
 * the conversation to Spam on its own, so an obvious case never spends a
 * completion. The classifier remains the fallback for everything the signals
 * don't catch.
 *
 * Three signals, cheapest first:
 *   - auto_responder      → RFC 3834 / bulk-precedence headers on a cold
 *                           inbound email (no thread context — replies and
 *                           loops are still hard-dropped upstream).
 *   - sender_auth_failure → the receiving MTA reported DMARC fail, short of
 *                           the p=reject policy that drops the mail outright.
 *   - burst_rate          → one sender opening threads faster than a person
 *                           types (a tighter window than the hard cold-inbound
 *                           cap, which drops rather than files).
 *
 * Every signal fails open: a Redis error, a missing header, or any thrown
 * error resolves to "no signal", leaving the thread in triage — the same
 * failure contract as the AI filter, whose trust-list bypass the caller also
 * applies before any of these run.
