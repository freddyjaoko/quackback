/**
 * Shared "this is content, not instructions" guard family: every surface
 * that folds text an end user or external system controls into one of
 * Quinn's prompts should look here first. Three surfaces need this today,
 * each with a different shape:
 *
 * - synthesis.ts (Ask AI): the customer's own question is passed straight
 *   through as the user message, never quoted inline, so its guard is a bare
 *   instruction sentence about "the user message" (`ASK_AI_USER_MESSAGE_GUARD`).
 * - copilot-transform.ts: a teammate-supplied block of text (the answer to
 *   rewrite, or their own draft) is quoted INLINE inside the system prompt,
 *   so its guard wraps that block in triple quotes (`wrapUntrustedText`).
 * - assistant.toolspec.ts's `executeSearchKnowledge`: retrieval results are
 *   untrusted a third way — excerpts already returned as structured tool
 *   output, so the guard rides along as a trailing `note` field
 *   (`RETRIEVED_CONTENT_NOTE`) rather than a prefix or a quote fence.
 *   Retrieved excerpts LOOK like the workspace's own material, but with post
 *   grounding on they are visitor-authored, and conversation summaries
 *   derive from customer messages — so they get the same framing as any
 *   other attacker-reachable text.
 * synthesis.test.ts and copilot-transform.test.ts both pin their surface's
 * wording via a loose `toContain('not instructions')` substring check, so
 * unifying the literal sentence would not break either pin — but the
 * surfaces guard genuinely different shapes (a bare instruction vs. a
 * wrapped quoted block vs. a trailing note on tool output), so this module
 * shares the MECHANISM (one definition per shape, in one place) rather than
 * forcing a single sentence across shapes that read naturally differently
 * in their own prompt.
