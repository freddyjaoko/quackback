/**
 * Field-level audit diff for identity-provider upserts.
 *
 * The `idp.updated` event used to record a hand-written `{ label, enabled }`
 * pair, leaving every field that actually decides identity resolution —
 * `clientId`, the endpoints, `scopes`, `claimMapping`, `autoProvisionRole`
 * — with no audit trace at all.
 *
 * That is a real privilege-boundary gap, not just thin logging: someone holding
 * provider-management rights could repoint the claim used for identity, sign in
 * as a colleague, and repoint it back, and the trail would hold two
 * byte-identical rows. Diffing the whole DTO makes both saves visible.
 *
 * Pure (no DB, no request context) so the rule is unit-testable and so the
 * server function stays a thin caller.
