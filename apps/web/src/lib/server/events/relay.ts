/**
 * Outbox relay (EVENTING-V2 WO-3) — the worker-role process that drains the
 * `events` outbox into the existing `{event-hooks}` BullMQ fan-out.
 *
 * Flow: a committed `emit()` fires `pg_notify('outbox_wake')`; the leader relay
 * (one per instance, advisory-lock elected) wakes, reads unpublished rows in
 * `id` order, resolves targets via the resolver registry, enqueues one job per
 * target with a DETERMINISTIC job id, then stamps `published_at`. Enqueue
 * happens BEFORE the publish stamp, so a crash mid-drain re-drains the row and
 * the deterministic job id makes the re-enqueue a no-op (BullMQ dedupe +
 * `hook_deliveries`) — at-least-once emission, effectively-once delivery.
 *
 * Reaction-loop guard: events whose `context.depth` exceeds MAX_DEPTH are NOT
 * fanned out (they'd be a workflow-caused-event cycle) but ARE marked published
 * so they are not lost or retried.
