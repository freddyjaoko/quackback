/**
 * The event catalogue: one `defineEvent` declaration per event type
 * (EVENTING-V2 §2.2). A single declaration is the source of truth that feeds
 * every downstream surface — webhook pickers + OpenAPI, workflow triggers, the
 * notification matrix keys, and the CI coverage gate — killing the ~5-file edit
 * and the "webhook advertises 4 events, supports 30" drift.
 *
 * This module (WO-1/WO-2 boundary) provides the machinery + registry. The
 * per-entity catalogue files (WO-2) call `defineEvent` at import time to
 * populate the registry. `emit()` takes an `EventDefinition` directly, so it
 * depends only on the interface here — not on any particular catalogue entry.
